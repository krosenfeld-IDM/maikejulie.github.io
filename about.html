							I am a physical oceanographer, interested in how we bring theoretical constructs and inferences
								together with observations to meet the needs of modern society. Combining domain knowledge
								with advanced techniques from data science, I aim to create new insight and accelerate
								exploration. I primarily see myself as a physical oceanographer, but have a formal background
								in computer science/data science as my thesis sponsored by the EPSRC was joint between
								the very diverse National Oceanography Centre, Southampton, and the excellent Institute for
								Complex Systems Simulation. I joined MIT as a Postdoctoral Associate working with Carl Wunsch,
								Patrick Heimbach and Steph Dutkiewitz, before going to Princeton University as an Associate
								Research Scholar. I have held visiting positions at Harvard University, and the University of
								Texas (UT) at Austin and I am currently a visiting scientist at the University of Washington.
							</p>
							<p>
							My service activities include convening and chairing at AGU, EGU, SCCS, the NOAA AI workshop and
								local seminars. Talks I have been invited to give include for the NOAA Senior Management Meeting (OAR), the Department of Energy, 
								AGU, the Max Planck Institute, the Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics and various colloquia. 
								I have served as a reviewer on a NASA panel and for numerous journals. My work has been featured 
								in the NOAA AI strategy 2021-2025, and I have authored two review articles (see publications).
								I am commited to raising awareness around climate change, and have contributed to the Carbon brief, 
								held sessions at summer camps and open days at museums.

						<h3>Teaching</h3>
							<p>Teaching is highly rewarding, and I received the Kaufman Teaching Certificate from MIT in 2017.  </p>
										<p>I have developed material for workshops at the graduate level:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM): Conference on Mathematical and Computational Issues in the Geosciences (<a href="https://github.com/maikejulie/SIAM_ML4Ocean">material</a>)</li>
											<li>Princeton workshop: "Machine learning for climate modeling"</li>
											<li>ICSS conference: "The importance of model validation" (<a href="http://sccs2014.soton.ac.uk/workshops.php">material</a>)</li>
											<li>ICSS conference: "Finite differences methods" (<a href="http://sccs2014.soton.ac.uk/workshops.php">material</a>)</li>
										</ul>

										 <p>Graduate level lectures I have given include:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Oceanhackweek 2020, “Elucidating Ecological Complexity: Unsupervised Learning de-termines global marine eco-provinces”</li>
											<li>Harvard University guest lecturers for Brad Lipovsky and Marine Denolle: "Machine Learning in Geoscience"</li>
											<li>Harvard University Data Science Club lecture: "The good, the bad and the ugly of applied unsupervised learning"</li>
											<li>University of Texas at Austin (ICES) Graduate Course guest lecturer for Patrick Heimbach: "Vertical Mixing Schemes: Why we need them & what they do''</li>
										</ul>

											<p>I enjoyed being a teaching assistant for these undergraduate courses (including
												<a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/oes/research/facilities/research_vessels/callista.page">boatwork</a>): </p>
										<ul>
											<li>NOCS Field work Boat Week</li>
											<li>Physical Oceanography II</li>

					 	<h3>Commitment to diversity</h3>
						<p>I believe that diversity is an asset, and that talent should be recognized regardless of race,
							size, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, gender-identity or sexual orientation. At Princeton,
							I am engaged in outreach to underserved communities, such as the Bronx Community College,
							and hosting interns from traditionally underserved communities. Mentorship has played an
							important role for me, and I am formally and informally mentoring graduate students. At MIT
							I worked to lower the financial barriers to the outdoors as a guide, bringing together
							diverse individuals in a setting otherwise inaccessible. As a teacher, I try to emphasize
							existing diversity through highlighting the diverse individuals that made the discoveries.</p>

								<p>I enjoy engaging with the wider community. A recent highlight that is hard to top is being a member
									of the <a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/copezilla-red-bull-flugtag-first-copepod-fly-charles-river">COPEZILLA</a>
									EAPS team for the Red Bull Flugtag. Kelsey Tsipis for EAPS News snapped a great photo of me at the
									<a href="https://eapsweb.mit.edu/news/2019/nautical-day-mit-museum">"Nautical day at the MIT
										Museum"</a>. Previously, my engagement found me helping an NGO at
									<a href="https://unfccc.int/process/conferences/past-conferences/copenhagen-climate-change-conference-december-2009/cop-15">COP15</a>
									communicating climate change, or being asked to present for the International and Industrial Advisory board of

								<p>Born in Copenhagen but raised in Norway, some of my favourite pastimes are found in the mountains
									are on a cliff, wearing trainers, climbing shoes, skiis, crampons or some combination. If ropes are
									involved then that is a bonus.  </p>

								<p>My main sport is distance running. In June 2018, I partnered with Katherine Rosenfeld to set a first
									and <a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/fkt/maike-sonnewald-katherine-rosenfeld-high-sierra-trail-ca-2018-06-22">fastest
										known time (FKT)</a> for running the 70+mile High Sierra Trail in one push. I am dedicated to
									increasing female participation in outdoor sports such as FKTs, by increasing underreported
									<a href="https://fastestknowntime.com/fkt/katherine-rosenfeld-maike-sonnewald-denny-creek-snow-lake-loop-wa-2020-08-19-0">
										participation</a>. I'm currently based in Princeton and Seattle, but my other
									favourite areas include the Isle of Wight, the Exmoor coast, and the Lake District
									in the UK, as well as the White Mountains in New Hampshire. I mainly run to explore the
									natural areas around me. The Vermont 50 mile trail race is the only race I've run where I placed 8th in my division.</p>

								<p>I am classically trained as a flutist and contemporary/classical ballet dancer.
									A series of injuries and life decisions set a stop to this, but I had the pleasure of performing at the
									<a href="http://ofp.nu/english/">Odd Fellows Palace</a> (DK), <a href="https://www.olavshallen.no/english">Olavshallen</a> (NO)
									or <a href="https://www.turnersims.co.uk/">Turner Sims</a> (UK). I was part of <a href="http://www.stepbystep.no/">Step By Step</a>, but joined just before they opened the <a href="https://www.skiforbundet.no/vm2021/vm-i-trondheim-1997/">World Championships</a>.</p>
